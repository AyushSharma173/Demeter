        "Try it if you like tomato juice or soup: I discovered V-8 in a vending machine at the YMCA swimming pool where I took swimming lessons when I was ten. I was a chubby pre pubescent kid and my mom wanted me to slim down. She was thrilled with my choice over a soda or sweet fake juice flavor drink. It was 25 cents for a big can. I drink it over crushed ice. Since it is less costly in the biggest bottle I buy largest size and use the extra as a base for recipes like gazpacho, home made tomato soup, Manhattan clam chowder, spaghetti sauce, Spanish rice and chili. I tried an off brand at Trader Joe’s once but it had an off putting spicy taste and I ended up taking one sip and pouring it down the drain. Apparently it has a following or the company would not still be selling it after 70 years. if you have not tried it but like tomato soup or juice,\ngive it a try. ",
        "When it comes to a wholesome and refreshing drink, V8 Original Vegetable Dreams stands out as a stellar option. Packed with a vibrant medley of vegetables, this beverage offers a refreshing burst of flavor that's perfect for any time of day. One of the noteworthy aspects of V8 Original is its commitment to health-conscious consumers by delivering a significant dose of essential vitamins and minerals. However, it's important to note that the sodium content might be a concern for those closely monitoring their intake. Despite this, the balanced blend of flavors and nutrients makes V8 Original Vegetable Dreams a delightful and convenient way to incorporate more vegetables into your daily routine. ",
        "This type of product was entirely off my radar until I had emergency surgery and was on a fluid diet. The hospital started giving me these veg juices, and I was really surprised at how appealing they were and how good I felt consuming them. Since I have continuing issues with fibrous foods making the consumption of many vegetables difficult, I decided to start adding these to my diet to help counterbalance that problem. These are a perfect size, and you can have them straight, diluted, hot, cold, doctored with herbs or whatever into a sort of soup; they are extremely versatile. My understanding is that they are predominantly tomato juice made from fully ripened specially grown tomatoes right at the source where this product is made, which I think you can taste; and the rest is a mixture of other vegetables. They appear to offer a lot of good nutrition in a small quantity, and are very low in calories. Easy to carry too nor does a can take up much desk \"real estate\". On top of that they are affordable and seem to hold up well in storage. Overall I think this is a great product. ",
        "I just happened to read the nutrition label on this tiny can of low sodium V8...wow! So, 5 or 6 gulps of this little veggie drink has exponentially more potassium in it (700 mg.) than one HUGE potassium pill (40)? I started drinking one 5.5 ounce can of Low Sodium V8 every night...it helped the hand full of pills (that I had to take every night since my heart attack) go down a lot easier than water. That was 15 years ago, and I haven't had a problem with my potassium levels since I started drinking it! You should always follow your doctor's instructions...but, if you don't like what potassium pills do to your gut, ask your doctor if you can try a low sodium V8 once or twice a day, instead. I even showed mine the nutrition label on one of my little cans...he was surprised. Who knows...it might work for you too. And, don't even get me started on how much I love the fact that the vegetables used to make this little gem, are all non-GMO now. SO... Non GMO, high potassium (for those of us on a diuretic), low sodium, and tastes fantastic..OH!...and it's a full serving of vegetables too! NON-GMO VEGETABLES! The only thing I could ask more of this tasty veggie juice is for an ORGANIC, non GMO version. I could ask...but I try not to look gift unicorns in the mouth. CUSTOMER FOR LIFE...15 YEARS AND COUNTING ",
        "This size V8 is perfect to carry on you when you need a pick-me-up and when you want a delicious drink low in sodium that is tasty. Most lower sodium does not taste all that great, however, this is very delicious no matter if you drink straight from the can or pour over ice, it's delicious. V8 has the recipe down pat, and I have yet to drink another tomato juice that is as tasty. Most other brands are either generic or not available in the personal, one serving size. this is a great way to sample if you like it also. I have purchased the case of v8 with 12 and 24 cans, they keep well and I usually keep them in the fridge stocked as well as in storage to replenish when the refrigerated is drank. this size is also perfect for recipes, premeasured 12 oz which is most common in recipes. I've used tomato-based soups, sauces, and main dishes, perfect! I also love that they serve this drink on Delta airlines, I always opt in for this for my vodka and V8. ",
        "('22) IC: #v8, @v8juice This V8 Juice is something good. I Love to drink in between meals and what not. Sure I can chomp on vegetables, but at times I want to drink a tasty V8 especially chilled if you will. They also come in a variety of sizes, cans and bottles for your pleasure. It's from concentrate ✓ Added ingredients water, tomato, carrots, celery, beets, parsley, and natural flavors ✓ Vitamins, etc. I would highly recommend V8 to anyone who likes to drink nutrients. Enjoy. Sold at almost any grocery store such as @walmart. ",
        "I enjoy the low sodium taste of this vegetable juice. It taste great and a good way to add vegetables in your diet on the go or as needed! I use this mostly for a fast drink with vodka and lots of fresh lemon or a meal replacement in Summer. I finely chop celery and keep it in water in the fridge then toss a handful in a glass, pour a cold can of this on top and add freshly ground pepper and lemon juice. Just chew the celery as you drink and it'll fill you up without a ton of calories, fat or carbs. On a hot day it's perfection and the lower sodium makes it better for me.. ",
        "I did. I do. 😉 Love V8 always have since I was a kid and my mom used to buy the little mini cans of them I still do I like the low sodium kind I know your body needs sodium but the regular has a little bit more than necessary not that there awful for you I just prefer the lower sodium ones. I like buying them in the cans cuz you can drink them and you know exactly how much you're getting and they're delicious. I haven't quite gotten my children yet into drinking them but can't blame me for trying. Definitely recommend these they're really good. ",
        "I LOVE THIS! Why isn't it on the shelves?: I've been buying and using this product, from Sam's Club for about the last 10 years. I will usually purchase 2-4 cases of this and 2-4 cases of the Low Sodium V-8 juice. Wanting to reduce the salt intake, I will take 2 of the 11.5 oz. cans and mix that with 2 of the low sodium in a half gallon pitcher. This will last me 4 mornings. I drink one (11.5 oz. glass) every morning. I am healthy as a horse (my doctors findings, I am 71 yoa.), and I attribute my health to drinking my vegetable every morning.\n\nWhat I'd like to know is, who is the genius that decided to no longer stock these products in the stores? If they are not available anymore I will shop somewhere else. Oh yeah, I typically spend $200-$300 every time I walk into this store. It is a 100 mile drive for me, so there really isn't a lot of savings for me. I'll bet I can get this somewhere else. Is Sam's trying to run itself completely out of business? ",
        "I love v8!! The low sodium version is the best taste. Not as much salt and does make you feel great after drinking it. Not sure if they have GMO veggies which would be a concern, but this veggie juice is a perfect break from regular tomato juice. Refreshing when cool but satisfying at room temperature. I like the peppery flavor and bright, light texture. It’s not thick and it’s not runny. "

        "Can save you a trip to the ER: These liquid IVs are just amazing. I live in Florida and I workout pretty persistently, in my garage with no AC. I've had some workouts that were so intense that after the workout, my body started to vibrate and lock up, leading to being paralyzed going into full dehydration mode, this has happened to me twice. The first time this happened, I was in a state of paralysis for a good 3 hrs, hr 1 I had another brand of electrolyte powder, but didn't think to drink it until after about an hr, after drinking a full jar of pickle juice and about 5 waters, nothing was helping, even after drinking the electrolyte mix, it took another 2 hrs to get me stabilized, I was right about to call 911 when I started to feel myself slowly bounce back. This past week, I had a similar incident, I began to have the same symptoms and I had to have someone else pour the packet into a bottle for me to drink, with a straw, because I didn't have mobility in my hands. I drank about 1/4 of the bottle of liquid IV and I began to regain mobility in my body, took about 5 minutes, I could feel my body beginning to calm down to come back down to normal. I ALWAYS have these in and when I workout, I make sure to hydrate throughout, but incase, I always have a bottle of water and a liquid IV ready incase my body gets to that point, in a place easily accessible. They're simply amazing, even my mother who refuses to try anything will drink them when she's having an IBS flare up. I also got my brother who runs marathons drinking these as well, especially when he's training, he also doesn't try anything, but he was struggling severely after training and I insisted he at least try one and he couldn't believe it actually helped him, so now he buys these as well. The strawberry flavor actually tastes really good! So far all of the flavors taste great, granted, when you're having an episode, the last thing you're thinking about is the flavor, nonetheless, flavor is still great. I don't like to drink these super often because I do have a habit of retaining water and these are full of everything your body needs to be level, so that's extra sodium, so I will drink regular water during my workouts and if I'm feeling off, I'll drink these. I'd like to drink them everyday, but between all of the extra salt that I'm sensitive to and their cost, they are pretty much strickly for emergency. ",
        "Electrolyte Hydrator for On-the-Go People: *Liquid IV Hydration Multiplier Electrolyte Drink Mix *\n\n*Appearance*\n\nThe Liquid IV Hydration Multiplier Electrolyte Drink Mix looks cloudy and not too appealing really. It might be better if they put a light blue or purple coloring to compliment the Concord grape flavor if they are trying to make it a grape drink. I reminded me too much of medication rather than a drink that I would use.\n\n*Taste*\n\nI’m not sure if this is to drink stand alone or mixed with something else because it’s grape flavor already, so I’m not sure it would blend well in with other things since it’s grape flavor. I didn’t notice much of a flavor really because of the citrus twang of the drink itself or the upset stomach it gave me like citrus drinks tend to give me since I have no gall bladder. This is normal for me with anything with Vitamin C in it with me though. It probably wouldn’t bother anyone else. I did not realize it had it in it at first.\n\n*Contents*\n\nThis Non-GMO drink is suppose to hydrate faster than water alone and 3X the electrolytes traditional Sports drinks can give. It has 5 essential vitamins including Vitamin C, B3, B5, B6, and B12.\n\nThe ingredients are Pure Cane Sugar, Dextrose, Citric Acid, Potassium Citrate, Sodium Citrate, Salt, Dipotassium Phosphate, Tartaric Acid, Silicon Dioxide, Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid), Stevia Extract, Natural flavor, Vitamin B3, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B6, and Vitamin B12.\n\n*Packaging*\n\nIt comes in a package that is easy to take with you and use on the go where ever you go to!\n\n*Conclusions*\n\nIf you can drink electrolytic drinks, you may want to try this since it was refreshing, but I wasn’t crazy about the taste. This is not Diabetic friendly if you notice all the sugars in it. ",
        "Good, but not my favorite flavor: Normally I do a pretty good job staying hydrated, so my preferred use is kind of specific. I get terrible headaches as well as migraines. Sometimes they lead to me not being able to keep anything down. Liquid IV has been a lifesaver in those situations. That is what works for me, and I am not recommending that to anyone, I am not a medical professional. During my headaches my taste buds get a little weird and any Liquid IV flavor tastes good, so I go with it. I keep packets everywhere for those just in case times. On a normal day most of the liquid IV flavors have been pretty good. This Yuzu Pineapple however is not my favorite. It’s not a bad flavor, but I would choose one of the others over this one if I had the option. This flavor left me feeling like I wanted to rinse my mouth out, almost like it felt coated. I don’t remember that with other flavors and all I can think is that it is the pineapple that does that. So it’s not a bad flavor, but I would choose another instead if I had the option. My second preferred use is that we are winter sports people, primarily snowmobiling. I find these mix ins really work to keep us focused and hydrated especially when we are on long trail rides and not stopping all the time to take a break. Winter air is very dehydrating and these help a lot. I wouldn’t say they are like having a jolt of caffeine or anything, but I feel more alert and more aware of my surroundings due to being hydrated and able to focus. For me and those 2 purposes, Liquid IV is a perfect solution. Highly recommend. ",
        "Liquid I.V. Energy Drink tastes weird: Reviewing: Liquid I.V. Energy Multiplier Energy Powder Packet Drink Mix, Yuzu Pineapple\n\nI tried this product once but whatever benefit I might have derived is adversely impacted by the rather unpleasant taste of the product. I am no expert on energy beverages as I have only consumed it once before with a different brand product. I was looking forward to seeing how it performed and decided to use in while working on a project with a short deadline at the end of the day when my energy reserves were a little tapped (I had just driven home from a road trip of 2.5 hours). The product comes in individual packets of which there are multiple, packed in a box. I recommend using scissors to cut open one end of the packet. Once opened, pour the powder mix into a glass and add room temperature water. You can either add ice or chill the mixed beverage. Stir well to make sure the drink is well blended.\n\nI wish I could say that I enjoyed the taste of this product but honestly it had a kind funky and salty taste. I had to force myself to drink it down. Someone else may find its taste alright but I don’t think that I’d care to drink it again. Having said that, I did detect a slightly higher energy level while working and was able to complete my project without tiring, despite having just arrived home after a long car trip. So if you can stand its taste this product just may be for you. ",
        "Disgusting; too sweet; ingredients NOT suitable for POTS/MCAS patient population: The watermelon flavor I ordered as a first time customer is like drinking a jolly rancher. So sweet I could not stomach it due to the excessive amounts of Stevia and natural flavors (which are unnecessary for a drink that already contains dextrose). Sadly, this product is also full of natural flavors and silicon dioxide, which can be problematic for the patient population that electrolyte drinks are often recommended for (i.e. POTS bc mast cell activation is a comorbidity). It is a red flag to me that my Dr. recommended this product. \"Natural flavors\" as an ingredient do not inform customers about the sources and carriers used to make that flavor. Stevia, natural flavors, and silicon dioxide, while generally safe, contribute to gastrointestinal disorders and allergies, especially in patient populations who medically need electrolyte drinks. This is all to say, I do not recommend this product, and I encourage Liquid IV to invest in an UNFLAVORED patient-friendly version without any Stevia, natural flavor, or silicone dioxide (as well as consider more sustainable packaging options). ",
        "Real sugar, great flavor, and no dye? YES PLEASE!: Initially, I went into this thinking yeah-yeah-yeah, yet another \"hydration\" drink that isn't WATER. Figured it would be some neon-colored garbage with corn syrup solids as sweetener...nope! This is made with cane sugar and dextrose, and there is NO dye. The flavor is really good, too- yes, it's an artificial grape, but it's a good one- nice rounded purple flavor, with a clean finish that isn't cloying. I will definitely buy some more of this, because during 'flu season, it's ALWAYS useful to have an electrolyte drink available, but to have one without dye in it is REALLY awesome. I am sensitive to blue and purple dyes, but I LOVE fake grape, have since I was a kid- so this is a total win. And the final bonus- 1 \"stick\" (which really, guys? It's a little bag, call it what it is!) makes a full pint. The flavor is strong enough, though, that on a hot day, I could see watering it down even further, by another 1/2 cup of water, to really be able to chug the stuff.\n\nIf you are on keto, this is probably not the drink for you, but if, like me, you're taking an extended break from the low-carb, sugar-free lifestyle, this is an excellent hydration and electrolyte beverage! Four thumbs up- kiddo liked it, too! ",

        "Excellent Hydration: When I received the Liquid IV hydration packs, I was in the middle of a bout of Covid, which followed a severe cold that had lasted two weeks. So basically, I had been feeling really crappy for about three weeks. Combined with the cold winter weather and our very dry climate, I was parched. I poured the packet into 16 ounces of water as directed. I was surprised at how good it tasted, the yuzu/ pineapple flavor is delicious. I pretty much chugged the bottle. After a few minutes I realized I actually felt a little better. I’m totally not saying that this stuff cures anything, but it made me feel better in the midst of being sick. I’ve been drinking it since then, for about a week, and I’m pretty much addicted to it. It dissolves very easily in cold water, you don’t have any little crystals left over. It doesn’t taste super salty like many other hydration drinks, it’s also not too sweet. I really enjoy walking, and in the summertime I get dehydrated pretty quickly. I think this Liquid IV will really help with that. It does have some calories, but I think it’s worth it. It definitely is not a replacement for plain water, but it has some flavor, and definitely makes me feel a lot less thirsty very quickly. ",
        "Magic in a packet: So I heard about the hype for liquid IV from influencers and decided to try it. It seriously enhances my life, and I’m a skeptic about most things. I have been drinking it for period cramps, and I don’t even need to take Tylenol anymore. I recently was traveling, which I typically don’t drink as much water as I should, and it helped, but I also got very drunk one of those nights; I didn’t have liquid IV that night as I should’ve, but the next morning (in which I was very hungover and I’m not in my 20s anymore) I felt much better within an hr after drinking this. I also just got my covid booster and drank some right away and during—I felt perfectly fine to do work the next day when I planned on being bed ridden. I’ve had these for a month now, and I can’t imagine my life without them. I have the tangerine vitamin C one, lemon lime, and passionfruit. I like them all since the flavor isn’t strong or weird tasting. But I like water them down a lot so it’s just an essence of a flavor…which also means I can stretch out a packet for a few glasses of water. The lemon lime seems the saltiest, and the passionfruit tastes like some kind of CapriSun. I bought these when they were on sale, but at this point, I would pay full price if I have to. Highly recommend, especially as someone who usually doesn’t feel compelled to write reviews. ",
        "This Energy Drink Mix Is Awesome!: The Energy Drink Mix Taste pretty good. It reminds me of Pedialite as it has a salty yet sweet taste. This Energy Drink Mix is a Pineapple flavor. It does taste good. In the beginning I was not enjoying the flavor as much but after day 3 I got used to it and then it began to taste good to me lol!\n\nAnyways let's talk real quick about my experience wirh the energy drink mix.\n\nI was able to remain awake, well alert and was overall in a great mood. The only thing I did not feel with the energy drink mix was Extra energy but that's OK. I have had coffee which helps me alot but after my coffee is warn out of my system I start to feel drained, that did NOT happened with this energy drink and that's a very good thing. In other words this energy drink mix kept me at what I would consider a normal energy level. I had Zero Iregular heart palpitations, I didn't feel jittery or the need to use the restroom often like I get with coffee.\n\nAnyways I am very happy with this energy drink mix and will be trying out the other flavors but as of right now the Pineapple is my favorite! This might just be a great replacement for my daily coffee.\n\nI highly recommend it! "

Koolaid (smoothest tasting)\n2. Freedom rocks ( good taste, weird aftertaste)\n3. Ring pop (sour)\n4. Tigers blood (sour)\n5. Smarties (sour)\n\nOverall they are all good\n\nJust ordered the grape but I think that one will be pretty good, of the regular pre I’ve only had the sunny d and it does taste like an orange drink but is just weird tasting when your about to hit the gym. ",
        "Best Preworkout: This is the best preworkout I have ever used. With a great cherry flavor and a euphoric mix of energy and focus, I have crushed PR's with this. First given to me by a friend, this preworkout created memories in my life that have changed my whole lifting career. If you are looking for a reasonably priced, great tasting, pump giving, strength enhancing preworkout, this would be the one. I will warn you though; as a beginner, this product would be very intense due to it's 390mg of caffieine and 3.5g of beta-alanine, so take with caution. All-in-all, this is a preworkout well worth your dollar that will leave you bigger and stronger than ever! ",
        "Ryse koolaid: Great pre honestly. Gives me the energy I need and the pumps are Insane. Definitely sticking to Ryse permanently. Wouldn’t ask for a better pre I can’t wait to try other pre workouts from ryse. The focus is definitely huge with this one , majority of other pre workouts don’t give you that focus but ryse definitely does. It doesn’t have that chalky texture that most pre workouts do and that’s another plus for me. The flavor is amazing only a little confused on why it doesn’t really taste like koolaid taste more like bubble gum to me , or maybe it’s just my taste buds lol other than that an amazing product ! ",
        "Worth Every Cent: This stuff is awesome! I have tried tons of preworkouts with mixed results. Some I crash hard on, some there’s no pump, and most taste like dog water.\nThis pre has the very best flavor I’ve ever tasted, no issue with it mixing in the water and the pump is hands down the best. It sits in my system all day it seems and it’s elevating my mood entirely.\nOnce it kicks in everything is itchy and tingly, but in a good way! This stuff makes you want to push, and push, and push, without even thinking. It’s improved my sets, increasing it by one additional set, weight is up, and I’m feeling good.\nIt’s got dope looking packaging, excellent, delivery times, and amazing results. Obviously everyone will react differently because humans are so complex. But in my opinion, this is worth every single penny, and I will continue to use Ryse products and recommend them to all my friends. ",
        "honestly, i love it. it’s: honestly, i love it. it’s my first preworkout i’ve ever owned and purchased. and i gotta say it’s good. the flavor is sweet and doesn’t taste stale or nasty, just like what the flavor says. Next it does give you that high stim. but be careful too much can make get itchy and can be too strong for your liking depending who you are. personally i take half a scoop because i have anxiety. The pump is decent, it feels like a regular pump without the pre, but just a little bit of a kick you know? overall the preworkout is a 9/10 i recommend it ASAP! ",
        "Great product much needed!! 💪: I love the way it taste. I could not be ready for my 6:15 am class without it.

I only use a half of scoop with 12 oz of water (give or take a little different) depending on your taste preference. I do not like it too sweet. I usually drink it on my way to the gym 20 minutes prior to starting working out. It does give me a tingle in my hands and feet. You definitely know when it is working. Good luck hope your give it a try. Great customer support as well. ",
        "YES: Yeah you wanna have amazing work out here is the stuff for You. I took this and man I had an amazing full body work out with the following\nFull chest session\nFull leg session\nFull back session\nFull arm session\nFull calve session\nFull forearm session\nMan I even hit the treadmill for a minute too\nI got home cleaned my room, applied to Harvard University, beat the AI computer chess with max difficulty man let me tell you\nLOADED PRE will let you see smells and hear taste have fun!!! ",
        "Eh.: I bought this with high hopes after seeing all of the marketing it has. It honestly didn’t get me going as much as I thought it would. It tastes decent, as close to actual kool-aid as it can get. I’m pretty disappointed with this and will go back to purchasing the other pre-workout that I used prior. I was looking at trying the ring pop pre-workout but I don’t want to be disappointed with that one also and waste my money. I only needed half a scoop with my old pre-workout but this one I need a full scoop and some which has never happened before. Glad I at least tried it though. ",
        "Too sour: The price i got it at was what made me buy it, but the flavor on it is SO sour and hard for me to finish without adding something additional to make it bearable. If you’re wondering how it tastes, try one of the popsicles but ONLY eat the white part of it instead of the red and blue, and thats how this tastes, but increase the sourness by 500%. Other than that the energy is gives me is good and the portions are good. Would i buy this flavor again? No… Would i buy a different one? Absolutely. ",
        "Great Pre - Insane amount of Caffeine: I love how this pre tastes, it has a great formula as well. I usually take another pre that has 200mg of caffeine so I initially tried this with a 3/4 scoop and man is it just a lot. I am worried to take a full scoop because of how much caffeine is in it. Would be 5 stars, but I don't even really think this much caffeine is safe to ingest, especially if it is marketed to younger kids. However, if you have a high tolerance or don't mind half scooping (but then you get half the pump formula ingredients) then this is very solid. "

When I tell you this cauliflower is so small and dirty-looking, I mean it! The online shoppers just give you the worst so they can get it out of the store. I wouldn’t even be surprised if this wasn’t on the front produce shelf and in the back of the store waiting to be tossed out. The moral of the story: Purchase fresh foods IN-STORE! If I could leave no star or half a star I would - gravely disappointed.",

When I tell you this cauliflower is so small and dirty-looking, I mean it! The online shoppers just give you the worst so they can get it out of the store. I wouldn’t even be surprised if this wasn’t on the front produce shelf and in the back of the store waiting to be tossed out. The moral of the story: Purchase fresh foods IN-STORE! If I could leave no star or half a star I would - gravely disappointed.",

        "Try it if you like tomato juice or soup: I discovered V-8 in a vending machine at the YMCA swimming pool where I took swimming lessons when I was ten. I was a chubby pre pubescent kid and my mom wanted me to slim down. She was thrilled with my choice over a soda or sweet fake juice flavor drink. It was 25 cents for a big can. I drink it over crushed ice. Since it is less costly in the biggest bottle I buy largest size and use the extra as a base for recipes like gazpacho, home made tomato soup, Manhattan clam chowder, spaghetti sauce, Spanish rice and chili. I tried an off brand at Trader Joe’s once but it had an off putting spicy taste and I ended up taking one sip and pouring it down the drain. Apparently it has a following or the company would not still be selling it after 70 years. if you have not tried it but like tomato soup or juice,\ngive it a try. ",
        "When it comes to a wholesome and refreshing drink, V8 Original Vegetable Dreams stands out as a stellar option. Packed with a vibrant medley of vegetables, this beverage offers a refreshing burst of flavor that's perfect for any time of day. One of the noteworthy aspects of V8 Original is its commitment to health-conscious consumers by delivering a significant dose of essential vitamins and minerals. However, it's important to note that the sodium content might be a concern for those closely monitoring their intake. Despite this, the balanced blend of flavors and nutrients makes V8 Original Vegetable Dreams a delightful and convenient way to incorporate more vegetables into your daily routine. ",
        "This type of product was entirely off my radar until I had emergency surgery and was on a fluid diet. The hospital started giving me these veg juices, and I was really surprised at how appealing they were and how good I felt consuming them. Since I have continuing issues with fibrous foods making the consumption of many vegetables difficult, I decided to start adding these to my diet to help counterbalance that problem. These are a perfect size, and you can have them straight, diluted, hot, cold, doctored with herbs or whatever into a sort of soup; they are extremely versatile. My understanding is that they are predominantly tomato juice made from fully ripened specially grown tomatoes right at the source where this product is made, which I think you can taste; and the rest is a mixture of other vegetables. They appear to offer a lot of good nutrition in a small quantity, and are very low in calories. Easy to carry too nor does a can take up much desk \"real estate\". On top of that they are affordable and seem to hold up well in storage. Overall I think this is a great product. ",
        "I just happened to read the nutrition label on this tiny can of low sodium V8...wow! So, 5 or 6 gulps of this little veggie drink has exponentially more potassium in it (700 mg.) than one HUGE potassium pill (40)? I started drinking one 5.5 ounce can of Low Sodium V8 every night...it helped the hand full of pills (that I had to take every night since my heart attack) go down a lot easier than water. That was 15 years ago, and I haven't had a problem with my potassium levels since I started drinking it! You should always follow your doctor's instructions...but, if you don't like what potassium pills do to your gut, ask your doctor if you can try a low sodium V8 once or twice a day, instead. I even showed mine the nutrition label on one of my little cans...he was surprised. Who knows...it might work for you too. And, don't even get me started on how much I love the fact that the vegetables used to make this little gem, are all non-GMO now. SO... Non GMO, high potassium (for those of us on a diuretic), low sodium, and tastes fantastic..OH!...and it's a full serving of vegetables too! NON-GMO VEGETABLES! The only thing I could ask more of this tasty veggie juice is for an ORGANIC, non GMO version. I could ask...but I try not to look gift unicorns in the mouth. CUSTOMER FOR LIFE...15 YEARS AND COUNTING ",
        "This size V8 is perfect to carry on you when you need a pick-me-up and when you want a delicious drink low in sodium that is tasty. Most lower sodium does not taste all that great, however, this is very delicious no matter if you drink straight from the can or pour over ice, it's delicious. V8 has the recipe down pat, and I have yet to drink another tomato juice that is as tasty. Most other brands are either generic or not available in the personal, one serving size. this is a great way to sample if you like it also. I have purchased the case of v8 with 12 and 24 cans, they keep well and I usually keep them in the fridge stocked as well as in storage to replenish when the refrigerated is drank. this size is also perfect for recipes, premeasured 12 oz which is most common in recipes. I've used tomato-based soups, sauces, and main dishes, perfect! I also love that they serve this drink on Delta airlines, I always opt in for this for my vodka and V8. ",
        "('22) IC: #v8, @v8juice This V8 Juice is something good. I Love to drink in between meals and what not. Sure I can chomp on vegetables, but at times I want to drink a tasty V8 especially chilled if you will. They also come in a variety of sizes, cans and bottles for your pleasure. It's from concentrate ✓ Added ingredients water, tomato, carrots, celery, beets, parsley, and natural flavors ✓ Vitamins, etc. I would highly recommend V8 to anyone who likes to drink nutrients. Enjoy. Sold at almost any grocery store such as @walmart. ",
        "I enjoy the low sodium taste of this vegetable juice. It taste great and a good way to add vegetables in your diet on the go or as needed! I use this mostly for a fast drink with vodka and lots of fresh lemon or a meal replacement in Summer. I finely chop celery and keep it in water in the fridge then toss a handful in a glass, pour a cold can of this on top and add freshly ground pepper and lemon juice. Just chew the celery as you drink and it'll fill you up without a ton of calories, fat or carbs. On a hot day it's perfection and the lower sodium makes it better for me.. ",
        "I did. I do. 😉 Love V8 always have since I was a kid and my mom used to buy the little mini cans of them I still do I like the low sodium kind I know your body needs sodium but the regular has a little bit more than necessary not that there awful for you I just prefer the lower sodium ones. I like buying them in the cans cuz you can drink them and you know exactly how much you're getting and they're delicious. I haven't quite gotten my children yet into drinking them but can't blame me for trying. Definitely recommend these they're really good. ",
        "I LOVE THIS! Why isn't it on the shelves?: I've been buying and using this product, from Sam's Club for about the last 10 years. I will usually purchase 2-4 cases of this and 2-4 cases of the Low Sodium V-8 juice. Wanting to reduce the salt intake, I will take 2 of the 11.5 oz. cans and mix that with 2 of the low sodium in a half gallon pitcher. This will last me 4 mornings. I drink one (11.5 oz. glass) every morning. I am healthy as a horse (my doctors findings, I am 71 yoa.), and I attribute my health to drinking my vegetable every morning.\n\nWhat I'd like to know is, who is the genius that decided to no longer stock these products in the stores? If they are not available anymore I will shop somewhere else. Oh yeah, I typically spend $200-$300 every time I walk into this store. It is a 100 mile drive for me, so there really isn't a lot of savings for me. I'll bet I can get this somewhere else. Is Sam's trying to run itself completely out of business? ",
        "I love v8!! The low sodium version is the best taste. Not as much salt and does make you feel great after drinking it. Not sure if they have GMO veggies which would be a concern, but this veggie juice is a perfect break from regular tomato juice. Refreshing when cool but satisfying at room temperature. I like the peppery flavor and bright, light texture. It’s not thick and it’s not runny. "

        "Can save you a trip to the ER: These liquid IVs are just amazing. I live in Florida and I workout pretty persistently, in my garage with no AC. I've had some workouts that were so intense that after the workout, my body started to vibrate and lock up, leading to being paralyzed going into full dehydration mode, this has happened to me twice. The first time this happened, I was in a state of paralysis for a good 3 hrs, hr 1 I had another brand of electrolyte powder, but didn't think to drink it until after about an hr, after drinking a full jar of pickle juice and about 5 waters, nothing was helping, even after drinking the electrolyte mix, it took another 2 hrs to get me stabilized, I was right about to call 911 when I started to feel myself slowly bounce back. This past week, I had a similar incident, I began to have the same symptoms and I had to have someone else pour the packet into a bottle for me to drink, with a straw, because I didn't have mobility in my hands. I drank about 1/4 of the bottle of liquid IV and I began to regain mobility in my body, took about 5 minutes, I could feel my body beginning to calm down to come back down to normal. I ALWAYS have these in and when I workout, I make sure to hydrate throughout, but incase, I always have a bottle of water and a liquid IV ready incase my body gets to that point, in a place easily accessible. They're simply amazing, even my mother who refuses to try anything will drink them when she's having an IBS flare up. I also got my brother who runs marathons drinking these as well, especially when he's training, he also doesn't try anything, but he was struggling severely after training and I insisted he at least try one and he couldn't believe it actually helped him, so now he buys these as well. The strawberry flavor actually tastes really good! So far all of the flavors taste great, granted, when you're having an episode, the last thing you're thinking about is the flavor, nonetheless, flavor is still great. I don't like to drink these super often because I do have a habit of retaining water and these are full of everything your body needs to be level, so that's extra sodium, so I will drink regular water during my workouts and if I'm feeling off, I'll drink these. I'd like to drink them everyday, but between all of the extra salt that I'm sensitive to and their cost, they are pretty much strickly for emergency. ",
        "Electrolyte Hydrator for On-the-Go People: *Liquid IV Hydration Multiplier Electrolyte Drink Mix *\n\n*Appearance*\n\nThe Liquid IV Hydration Multiplier Electrolyte Drink Mix looks cloudy and not too appealing really. It might be better if they put a light blue or purple coloring to compliment the Concord grape flavor if they are trying to make it a grape drink. I reminded me too much of medication rather than a drink that I would use.\n\n*Taste*\n\nI’m not sure if this is to drink stand alone or mixed with something else because it’s grape flavor already, so I’m not sure it would blend well in with other things since it’s grape flavor. I didn’t notice much of a flavor really because of the citrus twang of the drink itself or the upset stomach it gave me like citrus drinks tend to give me since I have no gall bladder. This is normal for me with anything with Vitamin C in it with me though. It probably wouldn’t bother anyone else. I did not realize it had it in it at first.\n\n*Contents*\n\nThis Non-GMO drink is suppose to hydrate faster than water alone and 3X the electrolytes traditional Sports drinks can give. It has 5 essential vitamins including Vitamin C, B3, B5, B6, and B12.\n\nThe ingredients are Pure Cane Sugar, Dextrose, Citric Acid, Potassium Citrate, Sodium Citrate, Salt, Dipotassium Phosphate, Tartaric Acid, Silicon Dioxide, Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid), Stevia Extract, Natural flavor, Vitamin B3, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B6, and Vitamin B12.\n\n*Packaging*\n\nIt comes in a package that is easy to take with you and use on the go where ever you go to!\n\n*Conclusions*\n\nIf you can drink electrolytic drinks, you may want to try this since it was refreshing, but I wasn’t crazy about the taste. This is not Diabetic friendly if you notice all the sugars in it. ",
        "Good, but not my favorite flavor: Normally I do a pretty good job staying hydrated, so my preferred use is kind of specific. I get terrible headaches as well as migraines. Sometimes they lead to me not being able to keep anything down. Liquid IV has been a lifesaver in those situations. That is what works for me, and I am not recommending that to anyone, I am not a medical professional. During my headaches my taste buds get a little weird and any Liquid IV flavor tastes good, so I go with it. I keep packets everywhere for those just in case times. On a normal day most of the liquid IV flavors have been pretty good. This Yuzu Pineapple however is not my favorite. It’s not a bad flavor, but I would choose one of the others over this one if I had the option. This flavor left me feeling like I wanted to rinse my mouth out, almost like it felt coated. I don’t remember that with other flavors and all I can think is that it is the pineapple that does that. So it’s not a bad flavor, but I would choose another instead if I had the option. My second preferred use is that we are winter sports people, primarily snowmobiling. I find these mix ins really work to keep us focused and hydrated especially when we are on long trail rides and not stopping all the time to take a break. Winter air is very dehydrating and these help a lot. I wouldn’t say they are like having a jolt of caffeine or anything, but I feel more alert and more aware of my surroundings due to being hydrated and able to focus. For me and those 2 purposes, Liquid IV is a perfect solution. Highly recommend. ",
        "Liquid I.V. Energy Drink tastes weird: Reviewing: Liquid I.V. Energy Multiplier Energy Powder Packet Drink Mix, Yuzu Pineapple\n\nI tried this product once but whatever benefit I might have derived is adversely impacted by the rather unpleasant taste of the product. I am no expert on energy beverages as I have only consumed it once before with a different brand product. I was looking forward to seeing how it performed and decided to use in while working on a project with a short deadline at the end of the day when my energy reserves were a little tapped (I had just driven home from a road trip of 2.5 hours). The product comes in individual packets of which there are multiple, packed in a box. I recommend using scissors to cut open one end of the packet. Once opened, pour the powder mix into a glass and add room temperature water. You can either add ice or chill the mixed beverage. Stir well to make sure the drink is well blended.\n\nI wish I could say that I enjoyed the taste of this product but honestly it had a kind funky and salty taste. I had to force myself to drink it down. Someone else may find its taste alright but I don’t think that I’d care to drink it again. Having said that, I did detect a slightly higher energy level while working and was able to complete my project without tiring, despite having just arrived home after a long car trip. So if you can stand its taste this product just may be for you. ",
        "Disgusting; too sweet; ingredients NOT suitable for POTS/MCAS patient population: The watermelon flavor I ordered as a first time customer is like drinking a jolly rancher. So sweet I could not stomach it due to the excessive amounts of Stevia and natural flavors (which are unnecessary for a drink that already contains dextrose). Sadly, this product is also full of natural flavors and silicon dioxide, which can be problematic for the patient population that electrolyte drinks are often recommended for (i.e. POTS bc mast cell activation is a comorbidity). It is a red flag to me that my Dr. recommended this product. \"Natural flavors\" as an ingredient do not inform customers about the sources and carriers used to make that flavor. Stevia, natural flavors, and silicon dioxide, while generally safe, contribute to gastrointestinal disorders and allergies, especially in patient populations who medically need electrolyte drinks. This is all to say, I do not recommend this product, and I encourage Liquid IV to invest in an UNFLAVORED patient-friendly version without any Stevia, natural flavor, or silicone dioxide (as well as consider more sustainable packaging options). ",
        "Real sugar, great flavor, and no dye? YES PLEASE!: Initially, I went into this thinking yeah-yeah-yeah, yet another \"hydration\" drink that isn't WATER. Figured it would be some neon-colored garbage with corn syrup solids as sweetener...nope! This is made with cane sugar and dextrose, and there is NO dye. The flavor is really good, too- yes, it's an artificial grape, but it's a good one- nice rounded purple flavor, with a clean finish that isn't cloying. I will definitely buy some more of this, because during 'flu season, it's ALWAYS useful to have an electrolyte drink available, but to have one without dye in it is REALLY awesome. I am sensitive to blue and purple dyes, but I LOVE fake grape, have since I was a kid- so this is a total win. And the final bonus- 1 \"stick\" (which really, guys? It's a little bag, call it what it is!) makes a full pint. The flavor is strong enough, though, that on a hot day, I could see watering it down even further, by another 1/2 cup of water, to really be able to chug the stuff.\n\nIf you are on keto, this is probably not the drink for you, but if, like me, you're taking an extended break from the low-carb, sugar-free lifestyle, this is an excellent hydration and electrolyte beverage! Four thumbs up- kiddo liked it, too! ",

        "Excellent Hydration: When I received the Liquid IV hydration packs, I was in the middle of a bout of Covid, which followed a severe cold that had lasted two weeks. So basically, I had been feeling really crappy for about three weeks. Combined with the cold winter weather and our very dry climate, I was parched. I poured the packet into 16 ounces of water as directed. I was surprised at how good it tasted, the yuzu/ pineapple flavor is delicious. I pretty much chugged the bottle. After a few minutes I realized I actually felt a little better. I’m totally not saying that this stuff cures anything, but it made me feel better in the midst of being sick. I’ve been drinking it since then, for about a week, and I’m pretty much addicted to it. It dissolves very easily in cold water, you don’t have any little crystals left over. It doesn’t taste super salty like many other hydration drinks, it’s also not too sweet. I really enjoy walking, and in the summertime I get dehydrated pretty quickly. I think this Liquid IV will really help with that. It does have some calories, but I think it’s worth it. It definitely is not a replacement for plain water, but it has some flavor, and definitely makes me feel a lot less thirsty very quickly. ",
        "Magic in a packet: So I heard about the hype for liquid IV from influencers and decided to try it. It seriously enhances my life, and I’m a skeptic about most things. I have been drinking it for period cramps, and I don’t even need to take Tylenol anymore. I recently was traveling, which I typically don’t drink as much water as I should, and it helped, but I also got very drunk one of those nights; I didn’t have liquid IV that night as I should’ve, but the next morning (in which I was very hungover and I’m not in my 20s anymore) I felt much better within an hr after drinking this. I also just got my covid booster and drank some right away and during—I felt perfectly fine to do work the next day when I planned on being bed ridden. I’ve had these for a month now, and I can’t imagine my life without them. I have the tangerine vitamin C one, lemon lime, and passionfruit. I like them all since the flavor isn’t strong or weird tasting. But I like water them down a lot so it’s just an essence of a flavor…which also means I can stretch out a packet for a few glasses of water. The lemon lime seems the saltiest, and the passionfruit tastes like some kind of CapriSun. I bought these when they were on sale, but at this point, I would pay full price if I have to. Highly recommend, especially as someone who usually doesn’t feel compelled to write reviews. ",
        "This Energy Drink Mix Is Awesome!: The Energy Drink Mix Taste pretty good. It reminds me of Pedialite as it has a salty yet sweet taste. This Energy Drink Mix is a Pineapple flavor. It does taste good. In the beginning I was not enjoying the flavor as much but after day 3 I got used to it and then it began to taste good to me lol!\n\nAnyways let's talk real quick about my experience wirh the energy drink mix.\n\nI was able to remain awake, well alert and was overall in a great mood. The only thing I did not feel with the energy drink mix was Extra energy but that's OK. I have had coffee which helps me alot but after my coffee is warn out of my system I start to feel drained, that did NOT happened with this energy drink and that's a very good thing. In other words this energy drink mix kept me at what I would consider a normal energy level. I had Zero Iregular heart palpitations, I didn't feel jittery or the need to use the restroom often like I get with coffee.\n\nAnyways I am very happy with this energy drink mix and will be trying out the other flavors but as of right now the Pineapple is my favorite! This might just be a great replacement for my daily coffee.\n\nI highly recommend it! "

Koolaid (smoothest tasting)\n2. Freedom rocks ( good taste, weird aftertaste)\n3. Ring pop (sour)\n4. Tigers blood (sour)\n5. Smarties (sour)\n\nOverall they are all good\n\nJust ordered the grape but I think that one will be pretty good, of the regular pre I’ve only had the sunny d and it does taste like an orange drink but is just weird tasting when your about to hit the gym. ",
        "Best Preworkout: This is the best preworkout I have ever used. With a great cherry flavor and a euphoric mix of energy and focus, I have crushed PR's with this. First given to me by a friend, this preworkout created memories in my life that have changed my whole lifting career. If you are looking for a reasonably priced, great tasting, pump giving, strength enhancing preworkout, this would be the one. I will warn you though; as a beginner, this product would be very intense due to it's 390mg of caffieine and 3.5g of beta-alanine, so take with caution. All-in-all, this is a preworkout well worth your dollar that will leave you bigger and stronger than ever! ",
        "Ryse koolaid: Great pre honestly. Gives me the energy I need and the pumps are Insane. Definitely sticking to Ryse permanently. Wouldn’t ask for a better pre I can’t wait to try other pre workouts from ryse. The focus is definitely huge with this one , majority of other pre workouts don’t give you that focus but ryse definitely does. It doesn’t have that chalky texture that most pre workouts do and that’s another plus for me. The flavor is amazing only a little confused on why it doesn’t really taste like koolaid taste more like bubble gum to me , or maybe it’s just my taste buds lol other than that an amazing product ! ",
        "Worth Every Cent: This stuff is awesome! I have tried tons of preworkouts with mixed results. Some I crash hard on, some there’s no pump, and most taste like dog water.\nThis pre has the very best flavor I’ve ever tasted, no issue with it mixing in the water and the pump is hands down the best. It sits in my system all day it seems and it’s elevating my mood entirely.\nOnce it kicks in everything is itchy and tingly, but in a good way! This stuff makes you want to push, and push, and push, without even thinking. It’s improved my sets, increasing it by one additional set, weight is up, and I’m feeling good.\nIt’s got dope looking packaging, excellent, delivery times, and amazing results. Obviously everyone will react differently because humans are so complex. But in my opinion, this is worth every single penny, and I will continue to use Ryse products and recommend them to all my friends. ",
        "honestly, i love it. it’s: honestly, i love it. it’s my first preworkout i’ve ever owned and purchased. and i gotta say it’s good. the flavor is sweet and doesn’t taste stale or nasty, just like what the flavor says. Next it does give you that high stim. but be careful too much can make get itchy and can be too strong for your liking depending who you are. personally i take half a scoop because i have anxiety. The pump is decent, it feels like a regular pump without the pre, but just a little bit of a kick you know? overall the preworkout is a 9/10 i recommend it ASAP! ",
        "Great product much needed!! 💪: I love the way it taste. I could not be ready for my 6:15 am class without it. It was recommended to me by a coworker that has tried many different things over 50 years of working out. I only use a half of scoop with 12 oz of water (give or take a little different) depending on your taste preference. I do not like it too sweet. I usually drink it on my way to the gym 20 minutes prior to starting working out. It does give me a tingle in my hands and feet. You definitely know when it is working. Good luck hope your give it a try. Great customer support as well. ",
        "YES: Yeah you wanna have amazing work out here is the stuff for You. I took this and man I had an amazing full body work out with the following\nFull chest session\nFull leg session\nFull back session\nFull arm session\nFull calve session\nFull forearm session\nMan I even hit the treadmill for a minute too\nI got home cleaned my room, applied to Harvard University, beat the AI computer chess with max difficulty man let me tell you\nLOADED PRE will let you see smells and hear taste have fun!!! ",
        "Eh.: I bought this with high hopes after seeing all of the marketing it has. It honestly didn’t get me going as much as I thought it would. It tastes decent, as close to actual kool-aid as it can get. I’m pretty disappointed with this and will go back to purchasing the other pre-workout that I used prior. I was looking at trying the ring pop pre-workout but I don’t want to be disappointed with that one also and waste my money. I only needed half a scoop with my old pre-workout but this one I need a full scoop and some which has never happened before. Glad I at least tried it though. ",
        "Too sour: The price i got it at was what made me buy it, but the flavor on it is SO sour and hard for me to finish without adding something additional to make it bearable. If you’re wondering how it tastes, try one of the popsicles but ONLY eat the white part of it instead of the red and blue, and thats how this tastes, but increase the sourness by 500%. Other than that the energy is gives me is good and the portions are good. Would i buy this flavor again? No… Would i buy a different one? Absolutely. ",
        "Great Pre - Insane amount of Caffeine: I love how this pre tastes, it has a great formula as well. I usually take another pre that has 200mg of caffeine so I initially tried this with a 3/4 scoop and man is it just a lot. I am worried to take a full scoop because of how much caffeine is in it. Would be 5 stars, but I don't even really think this much caffeine is safe to ingest, especially if it is marketed to younger kids. However, if you have a high tolerance or don't mind half scooping (but then you get half the pump formula ingredients) then this is very solid. "
